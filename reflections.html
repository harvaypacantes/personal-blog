        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Learning HTML and CSS as a first year BSIT student opened our eyes 
          to how the websites are truly built. We realized that even simple pages
          require planning, structure, and creativity. At first everything felt overwhelming,
          but as we practiced more, the pieces slowly connect. Now we understand how important it is to be patient,
          consistent, and willing to experiment sample projects to be able to learn and how to code, how to think 
          logically and design with purpose.  

          <h2>Realization</h2>
          <p>We realized that Html and CSS are the foundation of all web development. Without mastering them, we can't 
            build anything functional or visually appealing. We learned that coding isn't just typing symbols but it's 
            also about organizing content, choosing the right elements, and styling them to create a meaningful websites.
            Most importantly, we realized that these languages takes time, practice, and curiosity to develop a website that is 
            worth it.
