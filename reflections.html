            <p>Being a first year BSIT student has been exciting but challenging for us.</p>
            <p>At first, we felt overwhelmed by new concepts and fast-paced lessons.</p>
            <p>But we realized that learning IT is not just about memorizing codes,</p>
            <p>its about problem solving,patience and persistance. Mistakes became lessons</p>
            <p>and small achivements built our confidence. We've learned that asking questions</p>
            <p>and collaborating with classmates are essential for growth. This journey taught</p>
            <p>us to embrace challenges and enjoy learning step by step.</p>
